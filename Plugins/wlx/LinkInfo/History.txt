    /==========================\
    |     Version history:     |
    \==========================/

Version 1.51:
  1. One very annoying bug was fixed: on some computers closing Lister window resulted
     in closing Total Commander itself.

Version 1.5:
  1. The icon in Lister window is now showed always, for absolutely all link files.
  2. In Link Editor dialog when starting Choose Icon dialog, the defualt icon is the
     same icon that is showed (not always, but in most cases). Due to Win9x restrictions,
     in these systems this possibility works more seldom.
  3. Fixed bug with saving links on system objects.
  4. Now links on system objects has correct Target field.

Version 1.42:
  1. The icon now is drawn on the same background as main RichEdit background (before it was drawn
     always on white).
  2. Added possibility for calling commands "Save", "Save As...", "Close" on dialog from keyboard
     (letters for calling are underlined, as in menus).
  3. The icon of link on folder is now showed.

Version 1.41:
  1. Fixed bug that appears on al systems except WinXP and Win2003.

Version 1.4:
  1. Link Editor dialog can now change its size, the size and position being saved and restored
     on following starts (if the dialog is calles from the Lister, then it restores only size,
     as the position is set accordingly to the context menu position).
  2. The icon is now showed not only in the Lister windowm but also in the dialog.
  3. To the icon number field in the dialog spin arrown Up/Down are added.
  4. Now the icon in Lister window is not separate picture drawn over the text, but a normal
     OLE-object of RichEdit control - it can be copied to the clipboard, drag&dropped by mouse etc.
  5. Fixed bug with viewing several files simultaneously.
  6. The text of hotkey showed in Lister is now correct for all keys (before it was correct only for
     letters and digits).
  7. And many many minor bug fixes...

Version 1.31:
  1. Now the file icon is shown in the Lister window. This picture is not a part of the
     document shown, so it is cannot be selected, copied and so on. All it will appear
     in the future, but only in the case it is really necessary for somebody.
  2. The plugin/program became more compatible with Win9x. Earlier the Choose Icon dialog
     worked improperly - incorrect start path, questions instead of the path selected...

Version 1.3:
  1. At last the malicious bug was fixed that I tried to catch for very long time - on
     some computers plugin didn't work. Now, I hope, it will be OK.
  2. On pressing ContextMenu key menu appears in the center of the Lister window.
  3. Editor dialog now appears on the place where mouse was when calling the context menu
     (if it was called from mouse, not from keyboard).
  4. Dialog of the folder choosing now contains the starting path with the folder specified
     in the link information (before it was always "My computer").
  5. Corrected sizes of text fields on the Choose Folder dialog.
  6. All dialogs that appear on pressing "..." button now have start paths specified in
     the appropriate input boxes.

Version 1.21:
  1. Fixed program crash when pressing "Choose Icon" button.
  2. Fixed icon number (it can now be seen as negative).

Version 1.2:
  1. In this version the integration between 2 parts is complete. Now one can right-click
     in Lister-window and choose menu item "Edit..." to edit the LNK-file being viewed.
     After the saving the dialog window os closed and Lister window updated automatically.
  2. In dialogs of editing the "Choose Icon" button is now active.
  3. WinXP manifest added for better look in Windows XP.
  4. Project parts are renamed.

Version 1.1:
  The next version. In this version a possibility of editing link files is added. Now when
  someone opens LNK-file, all dialog fieald are filled in with the data from the link opened.

Version 1.0:
  The first version of program. It allows to create new link-files with the user-specified information.
  One can specify:
  1. Target file name
  2. Command-line arguments
  3. Working folder of the program
  4. Comments for this link
  5. Hotkey
  6. The file that contains the icon for this link and the icon number in this file
  7. Window size for the program
  The first version of plugin allows to view all this information.
