Command Line: Keys
==================

If Total Commander is active, nearly all keyboard input is directed to the command line.
Here the layout for some keys:

ENTER                  The command line is executed, if it contains at least one character
                       (otherwise, the program under the cursor in the source window is started).
                       If the command is cd, md or rd, it is executed internally. If it is an
                       internal DOS command, DOS will be executed with this command. Otherwise,
                       a program with the given name is executed.
SHIFT-ENTER            Like ENTER, but with preceding command /c. After the called DOS program
                       is terminated, its window is not automatically closed. This will only
                       work if the file noclose.pif is in your windows directory.
CTRL-ENTER             The file under the cursor in the source directory is appended to the
                       command line.
CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER       The file under the cursor including its path is appended to the command
                       line.
CTRL-CURSORDOWN or     A list with the latest command lines (history-list) is opened. Hold down
ALT+F8                 the CTRL key and use the up and down cursor keys to select an entry. By
                       pressing the left or right key, you can edit the command line. This
                       automatically closes the list.
TAB or Cursor Keys     Puts the cursor back to the source directory. Cursor left and cursor
                       right move the cursor through the command line, even if the cursor was
                       in the source directory before. If brief was selected, these keys move
                       the cursor through the source directory. You then have to hold down
                       SHIFT to move it inside the command line. Cursor up and cursor down
                       move the cursor bar inside the source window, even if it was inside
                       the command line.
ESC                    Clears the command line, put cursor back in file window.
CTRL+Y                 Clears the command line, cursor stays in command line.
CTRL+C (32 bit)        Copy selected text to clipboard
CTRL+X (32 bit)        Cut selected text to clipboard
CTRL+V (32 bit)        Paste text from clipboard to command line.
CTRL+E                 Copy previous command to command line
CTRL+K                 Delete to end of line
CTRL+W                 Delete word to the left of the cursor
CTRL+T                 Delete word to the right of the cursor
