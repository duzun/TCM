      <P><BR><A name=Introduction>Introduction</A> <BR><BR>With RegCleaner, you 
      can easily remove obsolete registry entries from software that you may 
      have deleted ages ago. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A 
      name=What_does_RegCleaner_do>What does RegCleaner do?</A> 
      <BR><BR>RegCleaner deletes registry entries. You can delete DLLs with the 
      Shared DLLs feature, and shortcut files with the Startup feature. You 
      don't even have to know what the registry actually is to be able to use 
      RegCleaner. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=Why_should_I_use_RegCleaner>Why should 
      I use RegCleaner?</A> <BR><BR>You should use RegCleaner because it's a 
      good idea to keep the registry as clean as possible. Here are some 
      examples to help you understand how RegCleaner can truly help you: 
      <BR><BR>1. Say you've accidentally destroyed a nice shareware program what 
      has a 30-day trial period. Later on, when you notice that it's been 
      destroyed, you try reinstalling it, only to find out that you can't, 
      because the program thinks that you're just trying to get another 30 days. 
      If you first remove the program's registry entries, however, you may very 
      well be able to reinstall the software and recover your trial period 
      again. <BR><BR>2. You've found that your favorite program is an older 
      version, and you want to download the latest whiz-bang version. The 
      program, however, doesn't provide any uninstall utility, so you simply 
      destroy its files and cross your fingers. But, as fate would have it, when 
      you try to install the latest version, you see a dialog box such as this: 
      <BR>"Please uninstall the old version of this program before attempting to 
      run this installation." <BR><BR>Great, now what? <BR><BR>Hang on; you 
      simply remove the old program's registry entries with RegCleaner! Now you 
      can continue installing the newer program version that you wanted to have 
      originally (I'm using the word "programs", but most of these examples will 
      apply equally to games and other software as well). <BR><BR>NOTE: Some 
      programs register file types (such as: '.txt'), so when you've deleted the 
      program, Windows reports an error when you try to run files that are 
      registered to that program. RegCleaner removes, when possible, all of the 
      registrations done by that program. Now when you try to run files that 
      were registered to it, Windows will bring up a dialog box and ask what 
      program you now want to use with this particular file type. You can then 
      select a new association. <BR><BR>NOTE: In some cases, some programs have 
      made particular file type registrations that aren't written into the 
      registry. In those cases, RegCleaner won't help, but it's not RegCleaner's 
      fault, it's simply the way the programs were written. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A 
      name=Very_important_to_know>Very important to know</A> <BR><BR>If you are 
      not 100 percent sure that you have the original disk(s) for all items of 
      software on your computer, and then don't remove anything. In theory at 
      least, it's not dangerous if you remove registry entries of most software 
      that you may be using, since likely you'll just lose your settings and 
      some options, but there's always the risk that the software won't work at 
      all any more as well. <BR><BR>Also, if you see some 'software' or 'author' 
      like '! @#WFDSf"!4e2e2', you know that it's in the software section by 
      accident, <B>DO NOT REMOVE IT</B> It's most likely some (stupid) program's 
      (stupid) copy protection. <BR><BR>Example: Re-Volt and F-Secure's virus 
      scanners do these. <BR><BR>
        NOTE: You must agree to the <A 
      href="#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</A> on the top of this page to use RegCleaner. 
        <BR>
        <BR>If you disagree do not 
      use RegCleaner. <BR><BR></P></TD></TR>

    <TD bgColor=#ffffff><BR><A name=Software_Tab>SoftwareTab</A>

      RegCleaner will search the whole registry and remove every entry that is 
      created by the software you wish to remove. Of course, it's impossible to 
      remove all the entries, but RegCleaner removes all entries possible. The 
      main theme is security, there's no risk whatsoever to use RegCleaner. That 
      is, if you use it right. I would like to point out that if you somehow manage 
      to damage your computer with RegCleaner, It's not my fault. Read the <A 
      href="#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</A> for more info. <BR>
      This feature might look like a simple thing, but in 
      fact it's the most advanced feature in RegCleaner. And there is no other 
      registry cleaner that has a function like this one. This is the whole idea 
      of RegCleaner and cleaning the registry with RegCleaner. Registry cleanup 
      and all the other functions are quite simple and they are usefull only in 
      certain situations. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=Startup_List_Tab>Startup List 
      Tab</A> <BR><BR>Here lies the list that shows every program that is 
      started from the registry and from start menu at the same time as windows 
      starts. These programs can easily use an obscene amount of your computer's 
      memory and decrease performance. Keep this list as empty as possible. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=Uninstall_Menu_Tab>Uninstall Menu Tab</A> 
      <BR><BR>Here's listed all the programs that are available for 
      uninstallation through Windows. You can access this list also from Control 
      Panel &gt; Add/Remove programs. The main idea behind this feature is that 
      you can remove the junk from the Add/Remove programs list. Like if you 
      have deleted some program rather than really uninstalling it. It's 
      uninstall stuff is still in that Add/Remove programs list. So with 
      RegCleaner you can remove them from there. You can also uninstall programs 
      with the 'Uninstall' button. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=File_Types_Tab>File 
      Types Tab</A> <BR><BR>Here's listed every file type or file extension. If 
      you have tried some program and it have registered some file types (That 
      means that you can access those files with a double-click. Example: you 
      can view .txt files with notepad by double clicking such file). If you 
      have found that program useless and uninstalled it, but some files are 
      still marked like "Some programs file". With this feature of RegCleaner 
      you can remove those unneeded file extensions. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A 
      name=New_File_Tab>New File Tab</A> <BR><BR>Try to click you Desktop with 
      the right mouse button, and select 'New'. There a few files that you can 
      create. Now, with RegCleaner you can remove some file types from that 
      list. <BR><BR>NOTE: Example WinZip and Adobe Photoshop add their files 
      ('WinZip file' and 'Adobe Photoshop Image') to that list automatically. If 
      you remove them, they add them in there again. <BR><BR>NOTE II: This 
      feature should not work under Windows95. It has been reported that it 
      doesn't work, but I haven't been able to confirm this myself, try it. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=Shell_Extensions_Tab>Shell Extensions Tab</A> 
      <BR><BR>Here's a list of all the file associations. Example: If you 
      right-click an mp3 file, there's some special items on the popup menu, 
      with RegCleaner you can remove those extra commands you don't need. 
      Example: If you don't even have a printer you don't need ability to print 
      some files with a right-click. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=Backups_Tab>Backups 
      Tab</A> <BR><BR>Here lies the list of current backups. <BR>If you can't 
      see the sections of text(the lines are too long), you can right-click the 
      item you want to see better and a popup will show it. Click the popup to 
      hide it. This works also in other sections, but there you have to only 
      move the mouse over the popup to make it go away. <BR><BR>NOTE: The 
      backups aren't removed even after you have restored them, if you want to 
      delete some backups; you will have to delete them by clicking the 'Remove 
      selected' button. It's safer this way. <BR><BR><BR></TD></TR>

      this might find some things you can't. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A

      file, not just the obsolete (because it's impossible for RegCleaner to 
      know which ones are obsolete). You can mess up your system really good if 
      you delete wrong DLLs, so please, leave this alone if you are not sure 
      what you are doing. <BR><BR><BR><BR><A name=View_DLL_Files>View DLL

      they should be safe to delete. Please note that RegCleaner will delete the 
      file and the registry entry and then both are backed up.

      specify what kind of Registry Cleanup you want. The options are 
      'mode:OLE', 'mode:cleanup' and 'mode:orphan', If you don't use any of them 
      then RegCleaner does them all. <BR>Example: RegCleanr.exe /automatic clean 
      /one backup file starts automatic cleaning and RegCleaner makes only one 
      backup file. <BR>Example: /RegCleanr.exe /automatic clean /mode:ole does 
      an automated OLE cleaning. <BR><BR>NOTE: You can use 'no backups' only 
      with 'manual clean'. The parameters are not case sensitive.<BR><BR><A 
      name=batch>Batch files<BR><BR>You can</A> operate RegCleaner with simple 
      batch files. This is very useful for administrating networks of many 
      computers.<BR>The commands are not case sensitive.<BR><BR>A batch file is 
      just a simple text file, it can be with any extension. Example:<BR>Tab 
      4<BR>Save list to "c:\filetypes.txt"<BR>Exit<BR><BR>This would simple save 
      filetype list to a text file and then exit. You can run a batch file with 
      /Batch command line parameter. <BR>E.g. RegCleaner /Batch "batch file.txt" 
      or you can use the Command Panel to execute a batch.<BR></P>

    <TD bgColor=#ffffff><BR><A name=Frequently_Asked_Questions>Frequently 
      Asked Questions</A> <BR><BR>Q: How do I remove the entries that I want to 
      delete using RegCleaner? <BR><BR>A: Simply highlight those entries that 
      you wish to delete (with your mouse "select" key), and then click with 
      your mouse on the "Remove Selected" button in the lower right corner next 
      to the "Exit" button. The entries you've selected will automatically be 
      deleted. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: What does the age-thing mean? <BR><BR>A: 
      It's just a way to point out the new entries. And by new, I mean entries 
      that you haven't seen before. So you don't have to read the whole list, 
      because the age-thing makes the new entries appear on the top of the list. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Does the registry cleanup work with every Operating 
      System? <BR><BR>A: Yes, it supports every OS that RegCleaner itself 
      supports (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows98 SE, Windows ME, Windows NT4, 
      and Windows 2000). <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: What's the difference between 
      'Uninstall' and 'Remove selected' button in the uninstallation screen? 
      <BR><BR>A: Uninstall button uninstalls the program but the 'Remove 
      selected' button only removes the program from the list. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: What are those "unknown entries?" <BR><BR>A: They 
      can be anything. Might be some copy protection stuff or just some 
      program's settings or something. You see, some programs just add their 
      stuff to the registry but don't bother to actually mark what program added 
      them. Actually quite stupid, but some programs just work that way. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Even though I have restored a backup it still is in 
      the backup section, why? <BR><BR>A: If you don't need that backup again, 
      then just delete it. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Do I have to delete the old 
      version of RegCleaner before I can install a new one? <BR><BR>A: You 
      should delete the old version if you are updating from an older version 
      (e.g. 3.8 -&gt; 4.0) but there압 no reason to do that if you are just 
      updating to a newer build (e.g. 4.0.740 -&gt; 4.0.744) nor if you are 
      getting a newer edition (e.g. 4.0 -&gt; 4.1).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: How do 
      I uninstall RegCleaner? <BR><BR>A: Just delete it or use the installer 
      (Options &gt; RegCleaner &gt; Uninstall RegCleaner) <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: 
      Are entries marked with "N/A" always safe to remove? <BR><BR>A: No! 
      RegCleaner will tell you if there is some generic rules to find most 
      likely useless entries. For example N/A entries should be safe to delete 
      in File Types-section. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Is RegCleaner free? 
      <BR><BR>A: Yes, 100% free. No sponsor banners, nothing. A true freeware. 
      <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Does RegCleaner contain so-called 'easter eggs?' 
      <BR><BR>A: Yes it does.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: What are 'easter eggs?' 
      <BR><BR>A: Hidden features, usually something funny.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Q: Why 
      doesn't the Uninstall Program or the feature in the Control Panel remove 
      everything that has been installed from the beginning of the system? 
      <BR><BR>A: First of all, some of the programs you install don't have an 
      uninstallation program. Most of these applications don't need any special 
      uninstallation, but some do. Many programs leave theirsettings stored in 
      the registry, in case that, the user, some day in the future installs it 
      again, then usersdon't have to set it up, because they did it already. 
      This on one hand is logical, but on the otherhand, stupid. So there was 
      really no point to uninstalling it in the first place. But the vast 
      majority of left-overentries are in the registry because the user didn't 
      use the uninstaller and just deleted the program's folder.
